## About Me

#<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi. I am a first year PhD researcher in moral psychology & AI ethics at the University of Edinburgh. 

I work at the intersection of psychology and philosophy, exploring the role of artificial intelligence in the landscape of human morality - how people make moral judgements about AI, and how AI shapes people's moral decision-making. I primarily use quantitative (frequentist/Bayesian) methods in R. 

My current research interests thus far include thinking and reasoning, moral judgement and decision-making, moral intuition and heuristics, political orientation, human-AI interaction, bio/AI moral enhancement, and AI/tech ethics.
