### about me

<img class="profile-picture" src="web-profile.jpg">

Hi. 

I am a 2nd year PhD researcher in moral psychology & AI ethics at the University of Edinburgh. I am affiliated with [School of PPLS](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls), and with [Centre for Technomoral Futures](https://www.technomoralfutures.uk), an interdisciplinary research centre focusing on the ethical implications of AI/data-driven technologies at [Edinburgh Futures Institute](https://efi.ed.ac.uk). 

Advised by [Dr Adam Moore](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/adam-moore) and [Prof Shannon Vallor](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/shannon-vallor), I work at the intersection of psychology and philosophy, exploring the role of artificial intelligence in the landscape of human morality â€” how people make moral judgements about AI, and how AI shapes people's moral decision-making. I primarily use quantitative (frequentist/Bayesian) methods in R. 

My research interests thus far include thinking and reasoning, judgement and decision-making, moral intuition and heuristics, motivated reasoning, political partisanship, metacognition, human-AI interaction, bio/AI moral enhancement, machine ethics, AI/tech ethics, etc. The list is, alas, growing. 

I received my M.A. Psychology (2020) and MSc.R. Psychology (2021) from the University of Edinburgh.
